Version 0021-1-Ultimaker
Erik: Added LCD support for Ultimaker and others (http://github.com/ErikDeBruijn/RepRapUltimakerFirmware/issues#issue/2)
Erik: Added support for BitsFromBytes extruder's thermistor (THIS HOT-END isn't recommended, I just had bought a few and one still works, so I made this temp. table) 
Erik: Further settings and cleanups for Ultimaker branch! (in configuration.h and pins.h)
